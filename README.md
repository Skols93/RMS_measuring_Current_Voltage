# RMS_measuring_Current_Voltage
Measure RMS power, based on the RMS values of the current and voltage

How it works?How it measure the values of the current and the voltage?

It works on the principle of the measuring transformers.Measuring transformers are types of transformers which convert the values of voltage and current to level that 
can be measured with instrument, in our case is Arduino.Arduino is collecting the samples which contains the values of the measured values of the current and 
voltage.Arduino is the 'brain' of the hole process to collect data, make the operations to get the RMS value.

Which method is used to determine the RMS value of current, voltage and power?

Graphical method is used to determine the RMS values of the current and voltage.The value of power is calculated with the Arduino.Graphical method is a good alternative 
for finding the RMS value of any non-sinusoidial waveform.
